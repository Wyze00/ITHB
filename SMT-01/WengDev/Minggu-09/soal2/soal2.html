            <p>It was a little strange to get the new summer-themed Chick-fil-A Smokehouse BBQ Bacon Sandwich on the day of an unseasonable May snowstorm in Salt Lake City, but fortunately deliciousness knows no season.

            <p>How do you like to eat your steak?

However you like it, you can never have too many steak recipes. Here then are five steak recipes from Gordon Ramsay, from sauced dishes to sandwiches. You're sure to find something you like in amongst these.</p>
